        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr>
         <p>I am a 25-year-old born and raised South African who is pursuing a career in fashion styling. I am currently learning web development and will be completing a BA degree in 2024 to broaden my job prospects. 
         </p>
        <p>For the past 8 years, I have held many different roles in the hospitality and customer service industry,
            which includes
            waiting, bar-tending and managing shops in many different types of establishments across the busy
            tourist city of Cape Town.
            </p>
        <p>I feel like I am the perfect asset for the role you have available as my experience working
            in the fast-paced on-set life in the fashion industry and my years of experience in the service industry have
            equipped me with all the interpersonal and job skills I need to prepare me for just about anything a work environment can throw at me.
